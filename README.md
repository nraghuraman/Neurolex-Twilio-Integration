# Neurolex-Twilio-Integration
This is a software demo project which I am doing as a part of NeuroLex Lab's Tribe 4 competition.

Currently, I am working on a system to send automated and recurring text messages via Twilio. This system will utilize a simple React frontend which users can use to configure the automated text messages. This system has many applications; for example, it can send weekly text messages to diabetes patients reminding them to check in with their health care providers.

A second phase to this project involving Twilio is coming soon.
