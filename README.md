# Neurolex-Twilio-Integration
This is a software demo project which I am doing as a part of NeuroLex Lab's Tribe 4 competition.

So far, this system is a web application which can be used to send automated text messages. This system utilizes a simple React frontend which users can use to configure and send the automated text messages. This system has many applications; for example, it can send weekly text messages to diabetes patients reminding them to check in with their health care providers.

To try out this system, run `npm start` in auto-text-backend followed by `npm start` in auto-text to open up the React app.

A second phase to this project involving recording voice calls using Twilio is coming soon.
